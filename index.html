                <h1>ECHO at a glance</h1>
                <h3>Why are we here?</h3>
                <p>Here at E.C.H.O., we are driven by a single goal; to establish a stronger, valuable bond between our partner charities, not-for-profit organisations and the real changemakers, You. </p>
                <p>We sadly realised there is an injustice in the UK charity sector where the largest 1.2% of charities in the UK receive 70% of the donations. Medium and small sized charities have no chance to keep up with the marketing battle for publicity. </p>
                <p>Their existence is essential, however they struggle to reach out for the majority whom therefore don't have enough information about the problems they are fighting against every day.</p>
                <p>So we decided to reach out for thousands of those organisations in the UK to help them to get the well-deserved attention and support by the public and in exchange people will be rewarded by unique experiences and priceless knowledge about environment, animal rights and social issues. What's the best part of it?</p>
                <p>Everyone wins!</p>
